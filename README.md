# surfs_up

1-	Overview
In order to live in Hawaii permanently instead of just visiting there occasionally, there is an idea to own a surfing shake shop, which will sell surfing attire and boards as well as serving ice cream to locals and tourists. We are going to help W. Avy to have a strong business plan, we see that one of the major concerns is about the weather as well as to find out active stations and the amount of precipitation. We are going to check December and June to see how the business will work during this time of year and come up with a business plan.
The purpose is to see which month is best to sell ice cream and surfing boards based on the weather, active sations and Precipitation.

2-		Results:

•	There are 9 active station sample data calculated in this project, If we can have more data in different locations we may know better about the best location to have this shop open.

•	We can observe based on the plot is that some months have higher amounts of precipitation than others. We will have better Idea if we have more data regarding precipitation levels of rain in Hawaii to decide exactly the best location and month of the year to have this shop which we plan to sell ice cream as well.

•	Comparing the two month June and December temperature, we can see that the temperature is better in June and we can see more activity around that time in Oaho and people are willing to spend more time during this time of the year in June.

3-	Summary: 

Overall, by checking the temperature of June and December we can see that, the number of samples was more than 1500 on both. We see that the min temperature is very low (56) in December compared to June (64). The maximum temperature in the other hand is very close to each other. The standard deviation is also very close to each other for both June and December which means they are not significantly different. So opening a surfing shake shop would be a good idea and will bring customers all year long , although some months may have less activities based on the temreture and the amount of precipitation of rain.
